# CSharp-Scanner
This repository is for Library code for Scanner Utility that has similar functionalty as the one found in Java. The Scanner class in Java provides helper methods to read the next primitive type from a specified Source. This repository's Scanner class tries to do the same with Generics. All .NET fundamental types are supported as they only need to implement the 'IConvertible' interface.
